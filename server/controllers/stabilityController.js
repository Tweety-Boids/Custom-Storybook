His posture is relaxed, with his hands casually in his pockets (or arms crossed, depending on preference), and he gazes into the distance with a calm and introspective demeanor. The camera captures his entire figure, ensuring a full-body composition with a straight-on or slightly low-angle shot for a dynamic perspective.The park around him is filled with lush green grass, tall leafy trees, and warm sunlight filtering through the branches, casting a dappled glow on the scene. A few park benches and people enjoying a peaceful afternoon are visible in the background, slightly blurred to maintain focus on the subject. The atmosphere is tranquil, with a soft breeze subtly moving his hair and clothes.",
